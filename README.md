# easy-capture
A camera app that lets you listen to music while you record.

## Why?
This is an iOS app meant to record video or take pictures. Originally, I want to record things while listening to music, so I thought that making an app for this would be good practise since I haven't played much with AVFoundation.
Next, I thought it would be fun to have a look at the metal framework, so the camera view is displayed using metal, straight from a pixel buffer.

## To do
- [ ] Flash
- [ ] Video/photo vault so one can listen to music while looking at the video
- [ ] Record audio w/ video
